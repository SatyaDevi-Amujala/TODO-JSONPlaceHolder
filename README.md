# TODO CRUD Project in React.js
# Objective:
Building  a TODO CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project using React.js.
Tech Stack:
● React.js for the frontend
● Bootstrap for styling
● JSONPlaceholder for the backend mock API
● Axios for API requests
Requirements:
Setup:
1. Initialize a new React.js project.
2. Use Bootstrap to style your application.
3. Set up routing using react-router to navigate between different sections of the app.
Home Page:
1. Create a home page that displays a list of TODO items fetched from the
JSONPlaceholder API.
2. Display TODO items in a responsive grid layout, with each item showing its title and
status (completed or not).
TODO Detail Page:
1. Implement a detail page that displays the full details of a selected TODO item.
2. Provide an option to mark a TODO item as completed or not completed.
3. Allow users to delete a TODO item.
Create TODO:
1. Implement a page to create a new TODO item.
2. Include input field for title.
3. Upon submission, send a POST request to the JSONPlaceholder API to add the new
TODO item.
Update TODO:
1. Create an edit page to modify the details of an existing TODO item.
2. Pre-fill the input field with the current data of the TODO item.
3. Allow users to update the title.

4. Send a PUT request to the JSONPlaceholder API to update the TODO item.
Code Splitting:
1. Implement code splitting using React&#39;s built-in mechanisms to improve initial loading
performance.
2. Divide your application into logical chunks and load them on demand.
Code Quality and Structure:
1. Follow a consistent coding style and formatting using tools like ESLint and Prettier.
2. Use meaningful variable and function names that reflect their purpose.
3. Organize your code into modular components for reusability and maintainability.
4. Properly comment your code to explain complex logic and functionality.
Folder Structure:
1. Organize your project&#39;s folder structure in a way that separates components, styles, and
utility functions.
2. Use appropriate subfolders to maintain a clean and organized codebase.
Responsive Design:
1. Ensure that your application is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes and
devices.
2. Use Bootstrap&#39;s responsive classes to achieve this.
Submission:
1. Upload your code to a version control repository (e.g., GitHub) and provide the
repository link.
2. Include a README file that explains how to set up and run your application.
Evaluation:
You will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
● Completion of all specified requirements.
● Code quality, including adherence to best practices and clean code principles.
● Proper usage of React.js concepts, such as components, state management, and
lifecycle methods.
● Responsive design and effective use of Bootstrap.
● Code splitting implementation.
● Thoughtful commenting and code documentation.
● Project folder structure and organization.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
